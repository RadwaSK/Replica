# Replica


## Introduction:
**Replica** is a motion-transfer based project.
We read about the idea first from the paper ["Everybody Dance Now"](https://carolineec.github.io/everybody_dance_now/)
We are following their general approach, with modyifing the algorithms of each module to which suits us best.


It contains on multiple main modules:
* Image Segmentation
* Pose Estimation
* Generative Addverersial Networks (GAN)

---

## Datasets Used
[Everybody Dance Now](https://carolineec.github.io/everybody_dance_now/#data) dataset is used for training our GAN model in developing phase.
After this, we uses our own dataset generated from input videos for training.
